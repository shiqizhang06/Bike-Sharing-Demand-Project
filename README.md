## Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
----
### Introduction  
Bike-sharing systems have become an essential component of urban transportation, offering a convenient and sustainable alternative to public transit and private vehicles. However, their efficiency depends on demand, which fluctuates based on external factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and seasonal trends. Predicting these variations is important for fleet management and ensuring bikes are available where and when they are needed.  

This project will analyze Seoulâ€™s bike-sharing system using historical data collected between 2017 and 2018. The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand), provides hourly rental counts along with weather conditions, seasonal indicators, and holiday information. The goal of this study is to develop a predictive model using regression techniques to estimate rental demand based on these external influences.
